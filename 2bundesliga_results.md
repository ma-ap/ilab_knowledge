FC St. Pauli fans had to wait 13 years for this moment: The FCSP is back in the Bundesliga! The Kiezkicker deserved this success, regularly offering respectable and efficient soccer under coach Fabian Hürzeler.

FC St. Pauli's season is a historic one - regardless of their sixth Bundesliga promotion after 1977, 1988, 1996, 2002 and 2011: For the first time in the club's history, the Kiezkickers finished the season ahead of their great rivals, Hamburger SV. As the duel between table neighbors Holstein Kiel and Fortuna Düsseldorf ended 1:1 and St. Pauli prevailed against VfL Osnabrück, the Kiezkickers can no longer be denied direct promotion.

The "Boys in Brown" will therefore play in the Bundesliga again from the summer; 2010/11 was their last season there to date. Under coach Holger Stanislawski, they went straight back down after promotion. Since then, the FCSP has knocked on the door of the Bundesliga a few times: immediately after relegation in 2011, St. Pauli finished fourth, level on points with Fortuna Düsseldorf, who were allowed into the relegation play-off against Hertha BSC due to their better goal difference and secured promotion there.

In 2022, the FCSP also looked like a certain promotion contender for a long time, finishing as fall champions and still leading the table on matchday 27. However, they only picked up six points from their final seven games and finished fifth, three points behind HSV in the relegation places.

The Kiezkickers then got off to a very poor start to the 2022/23 season, finishing the first half of the season in 15th place. And shortly before Christmas, Andreas Bornemann, Head of Sport at FCSP, made a tough but, in retrospect, justified decision: St. Pauli legend Timo Schultz was dismissed from his position as head coach and assistant coach Fabian Hürzeler took over as interim coach.

And what a start Hürzeler got off to with the FCSP: the "Boys in Brown" won ten games in a row and catapulted themselves from 15th place to fourth place in seven-league boots. It was only logical that interim coach Hürzeler became head coach Hürzeler. On match day 29 of the 2022/23 season, the team suffered a 3:4 defeat in the city derby at Hamburger SV - and then went on an incredibly long unbeaten run: the FCSP did not lose 27 competitive matches in a row and were only beaten by Düsseldorf in the DFB Cup quarter-final penalty shoot-out on January 30, 2024.

Almost two weeks later, after a season-long unbeaten run of 25 games in Bundesliga 2, they suffered a 1-0 defeat in Magdeburg.

However, unlike in 2021/22, when the Kiezkickers were clearly running out of steam at the end of the season due to the big chance of promotion, they kept their cool this season and fought back impressively after the (few) defeats: After the loss at FCM, they first beat in-form Braunschweig (1:0) and then fellow promoted team Holstein Kiel (4:3). When they then lost 3-1 at Schalke, the "Boys in Brown" did not despair, but beat three opponents who were not exactly easy to play against: relegated Hertha BSC (2-0), Nuremberg (2-0) and Paderborn (2-1).

Then came a novelty in the 2023/24 season: Hamburg lost two games in a row, first at in-form Karlsruhern (1:2) and then at Millerntor against the cheeky newly promoted SV Elversberg (3:4). Once again, one might have thought that the FCSP would stumble. Due to the two defeats, they had lost the lead in the table to Kiel. With two victories in a row, at rivals Hannover 96 (2:1) and against northern rivals Hansa Rostock (1:0), St. Pauli found their way back onto the road to success and to the top of the Bundesliga 2 table.
